Hinep Securin is a drone & UAV traffic-management system. It has built-in AI capabilities to generate real-time map of the aerial traffic.

Built for MoveHack 2018 by NITI Ayog.

## The App

The app commands a virtual drone to fly in a path around the Zurich University campus while plotting the path on a map.  It also displays the value of radiation intensity at each point along the flight path.

The app in its current form will not find the radiation source. It is up to you modify the app to suit your strategy for finding the building with the radiation source.

The app is composed of 4 files

1. index.html

2. server.py

3. radiation_sensor.py

4. user-account.json

The main workhorse of these files is `server.py`. In this file, a web server that operates on localhost though port 8080 is started. It serves the current position and sensor data of the drone.

The web server periodically retrieves the droneâ€™s position and the intensity value of the drones radiation sensor by sending Dronesmith API requests. In a separate thread from the web server, the drone is instructed to fly in a scripted path around the campus by issuing Dronesmith API requests.

In `index.html` the position and intensity values are periodically retrieved by sending a GET request to [http//:localhost:8080/data](http//:localhost:8080/data). Following each GET request, the drone marker and flight path are updated and a new circle with a radius proportional to radiation intensity is plotted at the latest position using the Google Maps API.

The file `radiation_sensor.py` serves as our mock radiation sensor. This file periodically gets a drones position and calculates a radiation intensity value using the latitude and longitude values. It then updates the intensity field value of the drones radiation sensor. You will need to run this code in a separate terminal before you run the server.py file.

The JSON file `user-account.json` is for storing Dronesmith API credentials.

Also included in the Github project is a setup script, `drone_setup.py`, that you can run to create a virtual drone with a radiation sensor object on your account.

## Prerequisites
To run this app you need a Dronesmith API key. Go to [api.dronesmith.io](http://api.dronesmith.io/) to request an API key. In a few minutes you will receive an email with your key.

You also need a Google Developers API key.

## Setup Python

Make sure you are using Python 2.7, not Python 3. Type python --version in the command line to verify your version.

If you're new to using Python, go through these two getting started exercises to set up your developer environment:

http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html

http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex1.html

**Install Python pip module:** https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

This should be included by default in latest Python version.

**Install Python requests module:** `pip install requests`

**Install Python geopy module:** `pip install geopy`

If you're on windows, you may need to run python -m pip instead of just pip.
